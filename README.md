# Machine Learning from Scratch
I wanted to dive into machine learning concepts and code with a lot of hands-on experience and understand algorithms in a clear and concise way.
The Goal is deep understanding and no shortcuts.

---

## Philosophy
- Understand Algorithms and Models very clearly.
- Type all the code from scratch with no AI code.
- Prioritize intuition over APIs.

---

## Algorithms Implemented
- Linear Regression (inprogress)

---

## How to Read this repo
- Each Algorithm has a clear English explanation
- A Mathematical intuition (light)
- A Numpy-only code execution (sklearn maybe will be used in the future)
- Vizualizations
- Notes on failure

## Why this Repo Exists
- Most ML engineers(Myself included) know how to call libraries and functions, but might not know how it works.
- This repo is for understanding how things work.
