>this doc contains info on how Linear Regression works. With first principles and intuition prefered over math

So Linear Regression is where every data science course starts, and after doing my masters in Applied statistics and Data science, I have realized that is because Linear Regression is one of the most(if not most) simple models.

Explanation:
y = mx + c

We are trying to find the parameters(m and c) for this equation where 'y' will be the variable we are trying to predict and 'x' is the input variable.

Our goal is to adjust m and c continously until the overall error(the difference between actual and predicted values for each data point) is low/least.
